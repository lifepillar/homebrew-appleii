## Requirements

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh), [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io).


## Installation

    brew tap lifepillar/homebrew-appleii


## How to install formulas

For Homebrew formulas (programs built from source and/or launched
from the command line) use:

    brew install <formula name>

For casks (files inside the `Casks` folder, which install
already built GUI applications) use:

    brew cask install <cask name>

Example:

    brew install openemulator --HEAD
    brew linkapps openemulator
    brew cask install gsport

Refer to the documentation of Homebrew and Homebrew Cask for
further details about these and other commands.
